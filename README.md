# elite-barcode-reporter
Utility that will take the path to a file listing barcodes as an argument and produce an excel spread sheet with the information of folders associated to each barcode by querying the Elite Enterprise back-end sql server.

Elite Enterprise does not have this functionality, and the utility saves time in the Records department.
